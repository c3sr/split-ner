% An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
% settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
% before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
% (just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
% in the bibliography.)
% The available control fields are:
% 
% CTLuse_article_number
% "no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
% "yes" enables
%
% CTLuse_paper
% "no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
% "yes" enables
% 
% CTLuse_forced_etal 
% "no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
% "yes" enables
% 
% CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
% usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
% is not greater than this value!
% 
% CTLnames_show_etal
% The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
% Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal
% 
% CTLuse_alt_spacing 
% "no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
% "yes" enables
% 
% CTLalt_stretch_factor
% If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
% the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
% default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
% stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.
% 
% CTLdash_repeated_names
% "no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
% of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
% "yes" enables
% 
% CTLname_format_string
% The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
% guide.
% IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,
% 
% CTL_name_latex_cmd
% A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
% Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
% The default is empty.
