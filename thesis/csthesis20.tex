% Updated version of the ECE department's latex resources

% Use draftthesis for notes and date markings on every page.  Useful when you
%   have multiple copies floating around.
% Use offcenter for the extra .5 inch on the left side. Needed with fullpage and fancy.
% Use mixcasechap for compatibility with hyperref package, which does NOT like all caps default
% Use edeposit for the adviser/committee on the title page.
% Use tocnosub to suppress subsection and lower entries in the TOC.
% PhD candidates use "proquest" for the proquest abstract.

% NOTE 1: The Graduate College standards allow sections to be numbered by chapter number, section number, and subsection number. This means you can use the following commands within a chapter:
% \section{}
% \subsection{}
% \paragraph{} (does not produce a number)
% In other words, do not use the command \subsubsection{} and beyond!

% NOTE 2: The Graduate College is picky about access white space, so you should attempt to minimize access whitespace when possible. For example, Latex will move a section header and subsequent paragraph onto the next page to avoid having a section header followed by a single line of text. In this case, you should use the command "\clearpage \noindent" at the end of the first line text in the paragraph to try to bump the header and one line of text back onto the previous page.
