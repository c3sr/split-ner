First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Jiawei Han for his continuous guidance and support. Prof. Han's teachings, his principles and dedication to work has always been a source of inspiration for me and has encouraged me to pursue my research interests relentlessly. With Prof. Han, I can confidently say that I have been treated not just as his student, but as his family. His care extends far beyond the call of duty and I am fortunate to have got a chance of being his student.

I would also like to thank all the members of our Data Mining Group. We are one big family and it has been a pleasure to work with such a talented group of peers and share ideas. Especially, I would like to thank Xuan Wang and Jiaming Shen for their guidance throughout my course of study.

I am also very grateful to Dr. Youngja Park, my mentor from IBM Research, without whom this work would not have been possible. Thank you so much Youngja for always being there for me.

Besides, I thank all my friends, well wishers and family members for always having faith in me and for their motivation and support in times of need.
