Previous approaches like sequence labeling and question answering (QA) treat the NER problem as a whole. One single model must take a sentence as input and return mention tuples with correct boundaries and correct entity type. Another possibility is to have a division of labor. We break down the NER problem into a two-step pipelined process. In the first step (\textbf{Span Detector}), we detect all mention spans in a given sentence. In the next step (\textbf{Span Classifier}), we classify these spans into their corresponding entity type. Now, we can train two separate models independently which specialize in their own sub-tasks and together solve the NER problem. We borrow the basic intuitions of QA model to solve both our sub-tasks.
