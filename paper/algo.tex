\subsection{Problem Description}

Questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{one model or co-training of multiple models?}
\item{how to detect the boundary -- (1) sequence learning such as CRF (2) boundary known in advance from rules or NP (3) 2 index vectors as in Deep Learning for RegEx~\footnote{\url{http://dlacombejr.github.io/2016/11/13/deep-learning-for-regex.html}}}
\item{character vs pattern? (1) character level can learn the value range (2) pattern is better to handle data sparsity}
\item{how to judge the quality of intermediate classification results during the bootstrapping process? (1) CrossWeigh (cross validation) approach (2) rule-based}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Architecture}



\subsection{Features}
\textbf{Entity Features:}\\
We segment positive instances of the entity mentions into tokens based on the word separator and non-letter symbols.
Then, each instance is converted

\begin{itemize}
\item{Entity type embedding: the type of the target entity}
\item{Word embedding: tokens separated by space.  use pretrained word embeddings with updates}
\item{Subword embedding: tokens separated by character case, punctuation marks in a word}
\item{Character embedding}
\item{Pattern embedding: internal lexical and orthographical patterns of entity mentions}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Context Features:}\\
All sentences with the entity type as positive sample.
Sentence without the entity type as negative sample.
\begin{itemize}
\item{Entity Type embedding like word embedding}
\item{Embedding of the words in the context}
\item{POS tags of words in the windows}
\item{embedding of the entity types  appearing in the context}
\item{The covering entity types}
\item{sentence embedding: 
sentence embedding with words (? not sure if this is useful), 
sentence embedding after replacing mentions with entity type, and 
sentence embedding after replacing mentions with mention pattern (?)
}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Inputs:} A number of positive instances or an initial set of patterns (e.g., regex) 
\item \textbf{Initial Training Data Generation:} 
 Generate an initial collection of labeled documents, $L$, by matching the input dictionary or patterns in a data collection.
\item \textbf{Repeat:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Train classifier $C_e$ with the entity pattern features
\item Train classifier $C_c$ with the context features 
\item Classify unlabeled instances using $C_e$ and $C_c$ 
\item Add instances which $C_e$ and $C_c$ classified as positive instances
